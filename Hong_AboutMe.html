        <p><strong>Career Goal: </strong>I don’t know what I’m going to do when I grow up. I only know what I want to be. My name is Michael Hong, and I am a freshman at Dublin High School. When I grow up, I want to be a sound engineer. Being a sound engineer gives you a lot of creative freedom with what you want to create. You can create music through a variety of software programs, all in your own recording studio, and have fun doing it. I love listening to, and playing music, so a career where I get to do this everyday would be paradise. In order to achieve this goal, I would take as many classes on music theory as possible,learn video mixing and editing, digital signal processing, and music production. Learning the basics for sound engineering requires a lot of hard work and time, but once I become a sound engineer, I will have a lot of fun.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Strengths, Personal qualities, and Achievements:</strong> I have a couple noticable strengths and personal qualities. First of all, I have been exposed to music ever since I was a young child. I am very passionate about music, and becoming a sound engineer would allow me to pursue my dream. I am patient, well-organized, and positive, which are some important traits you would need while working with other people. Being able to cooperate and be friendly with other people is a huge part in being succesful in this field, and I believe I have these traits. I have demonstrated these traits through everyday life in the classroom, with my family, and while playing sports. A main part of a sound engineer’s job is being able to communicate with people, so I think I would be a capable sound engineer. These experiences and characteristics make up who I am, and who I will eventually become. Now, let me tell you some of my achievements.  As of writing this, I have only been in high school for about three months, so I will talk about some achievements in middle school. At my middle school, I did track and field for three years, and cross country for two. In 8th grade, I was a track team captain, and I made it to the tri-valley championship. Aside from running, I participated in the swing dance competition, where I got 3rd, and I did a project helping the victims of the fires in Paradise from 2018. For this project, we collected food and donated them to a food drive which would send the food to these victims. However, most importantly, I participated in CJSF (California Junior Scholarship Federation) where I helped with work around Dublin, and with activities at Fallon.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Abilities and work skills: </strong>From playing on a soccer team for eight years, I have learned that I am positive and encouraging to others. When a player on my team messes up, I tell them it’s ok, and encourage them to keep trying, which led me to believe a display these characteristics. Also, from taking a difficult class, I learned how to be organized and study well so I could get good grades on tests. These skill sets really helped me become a better student, as I am now able to succeed in my classes through hard work and good habits. From these good study habits, I am currently working on getting better at time management so I will be even more efficient when I study.
       <br>
       <br>
       Overall, I believe I have the skills necessary to become a sound engineer. My plan for the future will be fun, but only if I put in the time to learn. Thanks for your time, and please, feel free to keep exploring and browsing my website.
