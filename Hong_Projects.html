            <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> September 23 - October 9.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> To create a game and modify it while exploring MIT App Inventor and blocky code.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Type of Project:</strong> Group (2 people)

          <p><strong>Project Information:</strong> For our project, we had to follow a tutorial on MIT App Inventor to create a game called,”Oh My Spikes”. After completing the tutorial, we then had to modify the game by adding cool features, such as a harder difficulty. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Important Skills and Growth:</strong> As a partner, my role was to help code the game, document our project, and give feedback to other groups.The most important thing I learned from this project was that communication leads to success. My partner and I communicated very well, and therefore, we were very efficient. We were able to export files and send them to each other, so we were able to do more of our project on the weekend. We also learned that creativity is an important aspect of computer science. My partner and I weren't creative enough, and we ended up losing points for not adding more features into our game. On my current HTML project, I am willing to take some creative risks, and put new features into my website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Teamwork, leadership, and skills related to area of interest:</strong> For my partner and I, we both exemplified leadership, and good teamwork. Throughout the course of the project, we were always keeping each other on task, and communicating what to do next in our project. These illuminations of leadership and teamwork are what will make us better in the computer science industry, and for me, the sound industry. In both of these working environments, you have to talk and communicate with others, so being able to have these skills will make you succesful. Another skill that I learned from this project that can help to become a sound engineer is resilience. Being able to bounce back from a problem and be able to fix it is an important aspect of this field. If the music you are making isn’t what you want or expect, resilience is a key factor in having you keep trying until you suceed. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Technical and Professional Writing:</strong> For our project, we documented all of our work in a google document. You can see this document<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bcYA4yx0ZC73k4-ickbCmhI8USCwziFa-iDKB7wAl1M/edit" target="_blank"> here.</a> In our documentation for this project, we first brainstormed our ideas, and then put them into tiers based on how much we could get done based on the time we had. Then we got some feedback, first from another group in our class, and then from everyone in the class. With all the feedback we got, we decided to incorporate a changing background, and clearer instructions for how to play our game. Without this document, it would have been hard to improve our project in the ways that we did, and we wouldn't have gotten enough feedback and input for what we could change.
